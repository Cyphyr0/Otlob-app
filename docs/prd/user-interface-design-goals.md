### **Section 3: User Interface Design Goals**

#### **Overall UX Vision**
The user experience must be premium, trustworthy, and delightful. The app should feel less like a utility and more like a personal food conciergeâ€”a knowledgeable friend who shares the city's best-kept secrets. The core principles are:
*   **Effortless & Intuitive:** Navigation should be invisible, and the journey from discovery to order should be frictionless.
*   **Visually Rich & Appetizing:** The UI must be a feast for the eyes, using high-quality photography, a clean layout, and beautiful typography to make the food the hero.

#### **Key Interaction Paradigms**
*   **Visually-Driven Discovery:** Users will primarily discover content through engaging visuals, such as curated carousels and high-quality dish images.
*   **Gesture-Based Navigation:** The app will utilize standard, intuitive mobile gestures for scrolling, swiping, and navigating, ensuring a smooth and responsive feel.
*   **Minimalist Data Entry:** Forms and inputs will be minimized. Where necessary, they will be clear, simple, and easy to use.

#### **Core Screens and Views**
To deliver the V1.0 functionality, the following conceptual screens are required:
*   Onboarding (Login / Sign Up)
*   Home Screen (featuring discovery carousels)
*   Search & Filter Results Screen
*   Restaurant Profile Screen (with menu)
*   Dish Detail View
*   Shopping Cart & Checkout Flow
*   Live Order Tracking Screen
*   Order History Screen
*   User Profile Screen (including Settings, Saved Addresses, and Favorites)

#### **Accessibility**
*   **Target:** WCAG AA. We will aim to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure the app is usable by as many people as possible.

#### **Branding**
*   **To Be Defined:** A formal brand identity and style guide have not yet been created. The branding should evoke a sense of authenticity, quality, and modern Egyptian identity. Key considerations will be color palette, typography, and logo design.

#### **Target Device and Platforms**
*   **Target:** Cross-Platform (iOS & Android Mobile Devices).
