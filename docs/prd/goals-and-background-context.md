### **Section 1: Goals and Background Context**

#### **Goals**
*   To deliver a feature-complete, polished "Version 1.0" of the Otlob app that meets all university graduation project requirements.
*   To solve the "choice paralysis" and "erosion of trust" faced by users of existing food delivery platforms.
*   To provide a platform that champions local, authentic Egyptian restaurants and helps them gain visibility.
*   To create a delightful, premium, and trustworthy user experience that makes discovering food an exciting and frictionless process.

#### **Background Context**
The current food delivery market in Egypt presents a dual-sided problem: users are overwhelmed with inauthentic choices and untrustworthy reviews, while high-quality local restaurants are lost in the noise. Existing platforms, designed around advertising, fail to serve the user's desire for authentic discovery or the local restaurant's need for a level playing field.

Otlob addresses this gap by creating a trusted, community-driven ecosystem. By focusing on unique, trust-building features like the 'Tawseya' recommendation system and a fair dual-rating model, the platform aims to become the definitive guide for "Urban Explorers" seeking genuine culinary experiences, while simultaneously celebrating and elevating local culinary heroes.
