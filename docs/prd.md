# Otlob Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### **Section 1: Goals and Background Context**

#### **Goals**
*   To deliver a feature-complete, polished "Version 1.0" of the Otlob app that meets all university graduation project requirements.
*   To solve the "choice paralysis" and "erosion of trust" faced by users of existing food delivery platforms.
*   To provide a platform that champions local, authentic Egyptian restaurants and helps them gain visibility.
*   To create a delightful, premium, and trustworthy user experience that makes discovering food an exciting and frictionless process.

#### **Background Context**
The current food delivery market in Egypt presents a dual-sided problem: users are overwhelmed with inauthentic choices and untrustworthy reviews, while high-quality local restaurants are lost in the noise. Existing platforms, designed around advertising, fail to serve the user's desire for authentic discovery or the local restaurant's need for a level playing field.

Otlob addresses this gap by creating a trusted, community-driven ecosystem. By focusing on unique, trust-building features like the 'Tawseya' recommendation system and a fair dual-rating model, the platform aims to become the definitive guide for "Urban Explorers" seeking genuine culinary experiences, while simultaneously celebrating and elevating local culinary heroes.

### **Section 3: User Interface Design Goals**

#### **Overall UX Vision**
The user experience must be premium, trustworthy, and delightful. The app should feel less like a utility and more like a personal food conciergeâ€”a knowledgeable friend who shares the city's best-kept secrets. The core principles are:
*   **Effortless & Intuitive:** Navigation should be invisible, and the journey from discovery to order should be frictionless.
*   **Visually Rich & Appetizing:** The UI must be a feast for the eyes, using high-quality photography, a clean layout, and beautiful typography to make the food the hero.

#### **Key Interaction Paradigms**
*   **Visually-Driven Discovery:** Users will primarily discover content through engaging visuals, such as curated carousels and high-quality dish images.
*   **Gesture-Based Navigation:** The app will utilize standard, intuitive mobile gestures for scrolling, swiping, and navigating, ensuring a smooth and responsive feel.
*   **Minimalist Data Entry:** Forms and inputs will be minimized. Where necessary, they will be clear, simple, and easy to use.

#### **Core Screens and Views**
To deliver the V1.0 functionality, the following conceptual screens are required:
*   Onboarding (Login / Sign Up)
*   Home Screen (featuring discovery carousels)
*   Search & Filter Results Screen
*   Restaurant Profile Screen (with menu)
*   Dish Detail View
*   Shopping Cart & Checkout Flow
*   Live Order Tracking Screen
*   Order History Screen
*   User Profile Screen (including Settings, Saved Addresses, and Favorites)

#### **Accessibility**
*   **Target:** WCAG AA. We will aim to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure the app is usable by as many people as possible.

#### **Branding**
*   **To Be Defined:** A formal brand identity and style guide have not yet been created. The branding should evoke a sense of authenticity, quality, and modern Egyptian identity. Key considerations will be color palette, typography, and logo design.

#### **Target Device and Platforms**
*   **Target:** Cross-Platform (iOS & Android Mobile Devices).

### **Section 4: Technical Assumptions**

#### **Repository Structure: Polyrepo**
The project will use a poly-repository structure. The Flutter front-end application will reside in its own dedicated repository, and the .NET back-end service will reside in a separate repository. This provides a clean separation of concerns between the two parts of the project.

#### **Service Architecture: Decoupled Client-Server**
The high-level architecture is a decoupled client-server model. The Flutter application acts as a pure client, responsible only for the user interface and user experience. All business logic, data storage, and third-party integrations (like payment gateways) are handled by the separate .NET back-end service, which exposes its functionality via a web API.

#### **Testing Requirements: Unit & Integration Testing**
The testing strategy will focus on two key areas to ensure quality and correctness:
*   **Unit Testing:** To verify individual Flutter widgets, business logic classes (e.g., state management), and utility functions in isolation.
*   **Integration Testing:** To verify the integration between the Flutter application and the .NET API, ensuring that data is being sent and received correctly.

#### **Additional Technical Assumptions**
*   A robust state management solution (e.g., BLoC, Riverpod) will be chosen and implemented consistently across the Flutter application to manage app state efficiently.
