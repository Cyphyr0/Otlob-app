# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Boilerplate

Status: Review

**Epic:** Foundation & User Onboarding

**Goal:** To establish the foundational structure of the Flutter application and implement the complete user authentication and initial profile setup flow. This epic delivers the first piece of tangible, testable functionality: a user can create an account, log in, and manage their basic profile.

**User Story:**
As a developer, I want a new Flutter project created with a clean folder structure, a chosen state management solution, and basic theme/styling setup, so that I have a consistent and scalable foundation to build all future features upon.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A new Flutter project is created and configured.
2. A logical folder structure is established.
3. A state management solution is chosen and integrated.
4. A basic app theme is configured.
5. A placeholder home screen is visible after logging in.
