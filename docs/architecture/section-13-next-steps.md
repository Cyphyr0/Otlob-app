### **Section 13: Next Steps**

With the frontend architecture approved, the project will now transition to the development phase, following the BMad-Method workflow:

1.  **Document Sharding:**
    *   The `front-end-architecture.md` and `prd.md` documents will be sharded into smaller, manageable pieces. This will allow the development team to focus on specific parts of the system without being overwhelmed by the entire documentation.
    *   The `po` (Product Owner) agent will be responsible for this task.

2.  **Story Creation:**
    *   The `sm` (Scrum Master) agent will create user stories from the sharded documents. Each story will represent a small, implementable piece of functionality.
    *   Stories will be stored in the `docs/stories/` directory and will have a status of "Draft".

3.  **Sprint Planning & Execution:**
    *   The development team will review the user stories, estimate the effort, and plan the sprints.
    *   The development will follow the `SM -> Dev -> QA` cycle for each story:
        *   **SM:** Creates the story.
        *   **Dev:** Implements the story.
        *   **QA:** Reviews and tests the implementation.
    *   The status of the stories will be updated as they move through the development process (`Draft` -> `Approved` -> `InProgress` -> `Review` -> `Done`).

4.  **Developer Handoff:**
    *   The development team can now be onboarded. They should familiarize themselves with the `front-end-architecture.md` document, especially the developer standards in Section 11.
    *   The first task for the development team will be to set up the project and start working on the first approved user story.
